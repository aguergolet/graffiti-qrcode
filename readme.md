Created by Golan Levin and Asa Foster III for FFFFF.AT. Originally developed with Processing, a free, cross-platform Java programming toolkit for the arts.

## ABOUT
This free program loads a user-specified QR code image, from which it generates a topologically correct stencil PDF, suitable for laser-cutting.

We are converting this Processing code to Python in order to provide more freedom and produce QR codes for Brazilian urban artists for free. Special thanks to Golan Levin for sharing the original code. This Python version is converted by Andr√© Guergolet.

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Make a QR code image which embeds a short text.
2. Download and install 'Processing' from [Processing Download Page](http://www.processing.org/download).
3. Unzip 'QR_STENCILER.zip' to a folder.
4. Put your QR code image in 'QR_STENCILER/data/'.
5. Launch Processing and open 'QR_STENCILER.pde'.
6. Press 'Run' (Command-R) to start the stenciler.
7. You will be prompted to Open your QR code image. A default will be opened if none is provided.
8. After doing so, the program will generate a stencil PDF in the 'data' folder.
9. That PDF can now be opened in your favorite CAD software, for laser-cutting cardboard, etc.
10. After marking your stencil, test it with a QR reader, such as TapMedia's free iPhone app.
